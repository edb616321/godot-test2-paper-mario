# Template1 - Phase I Complete
**Date: 2025-08-27**

## ‚úÖ Phase I Achievements

### 1. Sprite Alignment System
- **CRITICAL FORMULA**: Y = 4.0, pixel_size = 0.01 for 800px tall sprites
- All sprites (Player, NPCs) properly aligned to ground
- CharacterBody3D at Y=1, Sprite3D child at Y=4
- Documentation created: `SPRITE_ALIGNMENT_CRITICAL.md`

### 2. Logging System
- Comprehensive logging with `GodotLogger.gd` and `ErrorLogger.gd`
- Three log files: runtime, console, and errors
- Autoload system for global access
- Real-time error capture and reporting

### 3. Scene Elements
- **Player**: Properly positioned at (0, 1, 20) - safe from water
- **NPCs**: Captain and Hickory with automatic patrol systems
  - Captain: 8-unit patrol radius, 3-second wait time
  - Hickory: 6-unit patrol radius, 4-second wait time
  - Both positioned safely away from water
- **Pond**: Circular water feature (radius 12.5) with proper shader
- **Platforms**: Four viewing platforms with stairs
- **Bushes**: Ring of decorative bushes around pond

### 4. Movement Systems
- **Player Controller**: 
  - WASD/Arrow key movement
  - Walking animation (alternating frames)
  - Proper sprite flipping based on direction
  - Water detection for movement speed changes
- **NPC Patrol System**:
  - Automatic patrol after initial wait
  - 8-point patrol pattern
  - Sprite direction updates
  - Safe distances from water

### 5. Bug Fixes Applied
- Fixed parse errors in ErrorLogger.gd
- Fixed missing Player Sprite3D
- Fixed NPCMovement.gd AnimatedSprite3D vs Sprite3D compatibility
- Fixed player floating (wrong Y position)
- Fixed player facing backwards
- Fixed pond rendering (raised from Y=-0.8 to Y=0.2)
- Fixed pond shape (square ‚Üí circular)
- Fixed NPC positions (Y=0 ‚Üí Y=1)
