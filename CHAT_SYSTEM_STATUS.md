# TEST2 CHAT SYSTEM STATUS

## âœ… CHAT SYSTEM IS WORKING!

### Date: August 20, 2025

## Console Output Confirms:
```
Chat UI loaded successfully
Player controller ready with sprite and chat system
NPC Captain movement initialized
NPC Hickory movement initialized
```

## How to Test:

1. **Run the game** - Start TEST2 project in Godot 4.4.1
2. **Move near NPC** - Use WASD to walk close to Captain or Hickory
3. **Press E** - Opens chat UI when near NPC
4. **Type message** - Enter your message and press Enter
5. **See response** - NPC responds with appropriate dialogue
6. **Press ESC** - Closes chat window

## Current Features:

### âœ… Working:
- Chat UI loads without errors
- Player can trigger chat with E key
- Chat window displays with NPC sprite
- Fallback responses for Captain and Hickory
- Server endpoint configured: `http://10.0.0.251:8300/npc-chat`

### ðŸ”§ Fallback Responses:

**Captain:**
- "Ahoy there, adventurer! Welcome to MYGAIA!"
- "The seas be calm today, perfect for adventure."
- "I've been guarding these lands for many years."

**Hickory:**
- "Well hello there, friend!"
- "Beautiful day for a stroll, isn't it?"
- "I've been walking these paths for as long as I can remember."

## Server Status:
- Game server running on port 8300 âœ…
- NPC chat endpoint responding âœ…
- vLLM Docker container on port 8100 âœ…
- Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B model loaded âœ…

## Known Issue:
- LLM integration has JSON parsing error
- Fallback responses working as temporary solution
- Full LLM responses will work once JSON issue is fixed

## Files:
- `scripts/ChatUI.gd` - Main chat interface logic
- `scenes/ChatUI.tscn` - Chat UI layout
- `scripts/PlayerController.gd` - Handles interaction with NPCs

## Testing Checklist:
- [x] Chat UI loads without errors
- [x] Player can approach NPCs
- [x] E key opens chat near NPCs
- [x] Chat window displays correctly
- [x] NPCs respond with fallback messages
- [x] ESC closes chat window
- [x] Game continues normally after chat

## CRITICAL RULE:
**Only the PLAYER talks to the LLM!**
NPCs ARE the LLM responses - they don't make separate calls.

The chat system is functional and ready for testing!
